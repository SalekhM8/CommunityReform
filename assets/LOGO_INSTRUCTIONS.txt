LOGO PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
============================

Please place your Community Reform CIC logo in this directory with the filename:

    logo.png

Logo Requirements:
------------------
- Format: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPG/WebP
- Recommended size: 300x300px (or similar proportions)
- File size: Under 200KB (optimized for web)
- Orientation: Square or wide horizontal format works best

The logo will be used in the following places:
1. Main navigation bar (60px height)
2. Footer (80px height)
3. Admin login page (80px height)

If your logo has different proportions or requirements, you may need to adjust
the CSS in styles.css:

    .logo-img {
        height: 60px;
        width: auto;
    }

The logo image from screenshot 7 shows colorful figures in motion with the text
"COMMUNITY REFORM CIC" and "EST. 2022". This design will work perfectly with
the natural color palette used throughout the site.
