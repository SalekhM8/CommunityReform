### Colors

The color scheme is defined in CSS custom properties in `styles.css`:

```css
--primary-orange: #F47920;
--primary-teal: #4FADA7;
--primary-blue: #5BA6D6;
--primary-pink: #E94190;
--accent-green: #7CC04E;
```

To change colors, edit these values at the top of the CSS file.

### Typography

The site uses the Inter font from Google Fonts. To change the font:

1. Update the Google Fonts link in `index.html`
2. Change the `--font-primary` variable in `styles.css`

### Sections

To add or remove sections:

1. Edit the HTML structure in `index.html`
2. Add corresponding styles in `styles.css`
3. Include fade-in animations by adding the `fade-in-section` class

## Form Integration

The contact form currently uses JavaScript simulation. To make it functional:

1. **Backend API**: Create an endpoint to receive form submissions
2. **Update JavaScript**: Modify the form submission handler in `script.js`
3. **Email Integration**: Use services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES
4. **Database**: Store submissions in a database for admin access

Example API integration:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/contact', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

## Admin Integration

The admin section is currently a frontend-only demo. For production:

1. **Authentication**: Implement JWT or session-based authentication
2. **Backend API**: Create endpoints for CRUD operations
3. **Database**: Store user data, submissions, and content
4. **Security**: Add CSRF protection, rate limiting, and input validation

Recommended backend technologies:
- Node.js with Express
- Python with Flask/Django
- PHP with Laravel
